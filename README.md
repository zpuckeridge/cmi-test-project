# Basic Event Form using Gatsby, Chakra and Getform

This is a basic form with validation built as a programming test for Creation Ministries.

The project leverages Gatsby for fast static site generation, Chakra for minimal and simplistic UI, react-hook-form for data validation and Getform for submitting/recording data.

It also uses the Gatsby GitHub Pages integration which is what currently is hosting the site.
